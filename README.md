# MyPSReadLine

This module contains a number of helper functions and customizations for the PSReadline module. _**These commands only work with version 1.2 of PSReadline on Windows**_. PSReadline 2.0, which is part of PowerShell Core, has significant changes that are incompatible with this version of the module.

This module is still under development and has not been released to the PowerShell Gallery.
